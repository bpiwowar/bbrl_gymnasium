The my_gym library is the place where I put additional gym-like environments.

So far, it only contains the CartPoleContinuous-v0 (with timit limit = 200 steps) and CartPoleContinuous-v1 (with timit limit = 500 steps) environments

Besides, the gym version is forced to 0.21.0 to avoid the large changes that have appeared after version 0.22


## Installation

```
pip install -e .
```
